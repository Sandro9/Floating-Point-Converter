Please note that this tool is still under development, some things might not work yet or some bugs may occour.

In step 1 the tool explains how to convert a decimal number into a dual number step by step.
In step 2 how the bias is calculated and how the floating point works(character)
At least we combine our character and the mantissa - thats the actual value which is stored on your disk.
